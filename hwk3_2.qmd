### Data Descriptions:

- The `Night Light Imagery` data is a collection of raster files containing the nighttime light intensity for the Houston area. It is from NASA  Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). VIIRS data is distributed through [NASA’s Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC)](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/). There are 4 tiles stored as `.tifs`, two tiles to cover the Houston area before and after the storm. The data was accessed locally.

- The `Roads` dataset contains roadways for the Houston Metro Area. The data is a subset of roads from OpenStreetMap (OSM) that intersect with Houston, prepared by Geofabrik [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/). It was stored by a geopackage, the data was accessed locally.

- The `Buildings` dataset contains polygons for buildings in the Houston Metro Area. The data is a subset of buildings from OpenStreetMap (OSM) that fall within the Houston Metro Area, prepared by [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/). It was stored by a geopackage, the data was accessed locally.

- The `Socioeconomics` data contains socioeconomic information for every home, by census tract, in the Houston Metro Area. The data is a subset of census data from the [U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) for census tracts in 2019. It was stored as an Esry file geodatabase.

*This map shows the difference in night light intensity between a typical night before the storm (February 7, 2023), compared to night light intensity after the storm (Feb 16, 2023), when the Houston region in Texas experienced widespread power outages. The night light intensity ranges from no light (dark blue), to pink (mid light intensity), to yellow (highest light intensity).*

*This map shows the homes in Houston, Texas that were likely impacted by the power outages, highlighted in turquoise blue. These buildings were identified by selecting buildings that overlap with areas where nightlight intensity had a drop of more than 200 nW cm<sup>-2</sup> sr<sup>-1</sup>. There were over 157,000 homes that were identified to likely have been impacted by power outages in the greater Houston Area.*

*This map shows the census tracts in Houston that were likely impacted by the power outages. Census tracts that contain homes that experienced a power outage are shown in turquoise blue and tracts where there were no power outages detected are shown in yellow.*

*This plot shows the distribution of median household income (based on 2019) by blackout status with median household income shown in U.S. dollars on the x axis and whether or not they experienced a blackout indicated on the y-axis. This figure shows that there are similar distributions between areas that did and did not experience a blackout, demonstrating that there is not a strong relationship between the two.*



`DESCRIPTION:`
*This project investigates the impact of a severe weather event in 2021 which caused widespread power outages throughout the state of Texas, including Houston. I use NASA Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) nighttime imagery to detect night lights to compare the intensity of night lights before and after the first major storm. I also overlaid the imagery with census tract data containing information on the median household income. I found that the median household income for census tracts that experienced a blackout was slightly higher then the median for tracts that didn't experience an outage. For this project, I did not normalize for area, so it is possible that the difference in sample size of each group could skew the observed median values. Additionally, it is possible that there could be omitted variables that impact the relationship between whether or not an area experienced an outage and the median household income.*
